**Introduction to Nginx**

Nginx () is a powerful web server that uses a non-threaded, event-driven architecture ().  It's primarily known for its role as a reverse proxy (), load balancer (), and HTTP caching () server.

**How Nginx Works as a Reverse Proxy**

In a typical HTTP connection, a client directly connects to a server ().  With Nginx acting as a reverse proxy, the client communicates with Nginx, which then forwards the request to the appropriate backend server ().  The response is then sent back to the client through Nginx (). This differs from a forward proxy (, , ) where multiple clients use the proxy to access a single server.  The key difference is that in a reverse proxy, the client is unaware of the backend server (), while in a forward proxy, the server is unaware of the client's true location.  Google Maps (, ) is an example of a website likely using a reverse proxy setup.

**Nginx Features and Advantages**

*   **Load Balancing:** Nginx distributes requests across multiple servers to prevent overload (, ).  Algorithms like round-robin can be used ().
*   **HTTP Caching:** Nginx caches frequently accessed content (like images) to speed up response times (, ).
*   **Handles High Concurrency:** Nginx can handle a large number of concurrent requests (10,000+) ().
*   **API Gateway:**  Nginx can act as an API gateway ().
*   **SSL Certificate Handling:** Nginx can manage SSL certificates ().
*   **Serving Static Files:** Efficiently serves static files like images and videos ().


**Configuration and Prerequisites**

To work effectively with Nginx, familiarity with Docker (, , , ) and basic Linux commands () is recommended.  A free Vultr account (, ) might also be helpful for deployment.  The instructor assumes basic Node.js knowledge ().  Nginx configuration involves defining rules for routing requests to different servers based on various parameters ().
