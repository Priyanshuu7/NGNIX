**Introduction to Nginx**

Nginx () is a powerful web server that uses a non-threaded, event-driven architecture ().  It's primarily known for its role as a reverse proxy (), load balancer (), and HTTP caching () server.

**How Nginx Works as a Reverse Proxy**

In a typical HTTP connection, a client directly connects to a server ().  With Nginx acting as a reverse proxy, the client communicates with Nginx, which then forwards the request to the appropriate backend server ().  The response is then sent back to the client through Nginx (). This differs from a forward proxy (, , ) where multiple clients use the proxy to access a single server.  The key difference is that in a reverse proxy, the client is unaware of the backend server (), while in a forward proxy, the server is unaware of the client's true location.  Google Maps (, ) is an example of a website likely using a reverse proxy setup.

**Nginx Features and Advantages**

*   **Load Balancing:** Nginx distributes requests across multiple servers to prevent overload (, ).  Algorithms like round-robin can be used ().
*   **HTTP Caching:** Nginx caches frequently accessed content (like images) to speed up response times (, ).
*   **Handles High Concurrency:** Nginx can handle a large number of concurrent requests (10,000+) ().
*   **API Gateway:**  Nginx can act as an API gateway ().
*   **SSL Certificate Handling:** Nginx can manage SSL certificates ().
*   **Serving Static Files:** Efficiently serves static files like images and videos ().


**Configuration and Prerequisites**

To work effectively with Nginx, familiarity with Docker (, , , ) and basic Linux commands () is recommended.  A free Vultr account (, ) might also be helpful for deployment.  The instructor assumes basic Node.js knowledge ().  Nginx configuration involves defining rules for routing requests to different servers based on various parameters ().


**Study Guide for Installing and Setting Up Nginx**

**Introduction to Docker**
- Docker is a form of virtualization that allows you to run applications in containers, which are lightweight virtual machines .

**Setting Up the Environment**
- Before installing Nginx, ensure your Docker environment is ready. You can connect to the terminal of your Docker container .

**Updating Packages**
- Update local packages in the container to ensure you have the latest versions before installation .

**Installing Nginx**
- Install Nginx using the command:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install nginx
  ```
  This command will initiate the installation process .

**Verifying Installation**
- After installation, verify that Nginx is running by checking the version:
  ```
  nginx -v
  ```
  If successful, you should see the version number displayed .

**Accessing Nginx**
- Nginx typically runs on port 80. If you're using Docker, you may need to map this port to a different one (e.g., 8080) for access . Access it via your browser at `localhost:8080`.

**Default Page Check**
- If you see the default Nginx welcome page, it confirms that Nginx is running correctly .

**Configuration Files**
- Nginx configuration files are located in the `/etc/nginx` directory. The main configuration file is `nginx.conf` .

**Editing Configuration**
- Use a text editor (like nano) to edit the configuration file. Before making changes, create a backup of the original configuration .

**Basic Configuration Example**
- A simple server block in the configuration file might look like this:
  ```
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name localhost;

      location / {
          root /usr/share/nginx/html;
          index index.html index.htm;
      }
  }
  ```
  This block listens on port 80 and serves files from the specified root directory .

**Testing Configuration**
- After editing, test the configuration syntax using:
  ```
  nginx -t
  ```
  This command checks for syntax errors .

**Reloading Nginx**
- If there are no errors, reload Nginx to apply the changes:
  ```
  sudo systemctl reload nginx
  ```
  This command ensures your new configuration is active .

**Conclusion**
- You can run multiple server blocks and customize configurations as needed. Experiment with different settings to understand how Nginx operates .

- **Key Concepts for Serving Static Content with Nginx**

- **Introduction to Nginx**: Nginx is a web server that primarily serves static files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It can efficiently handle requests for static content, making it a popular choice for web hosting .

- **Caching**: Caching helps reduce the load on the web server by storing copies of frequently accessed files. This allows for faster response times when serving static content .

- **Configuration Basics**: To serve static files, you need to configure Nginx by specifying the root directory where your files are located. This is done by setting the `root` directive in the Nginx configuration file .

- **Creating a Simple Website**: 
  - Create an `index.html` file, which is the default file served by Nginx .
  - The HTML file should include basic structure elements like `<head>` and `<body>` .

- **Serving Static Files**: 
  - After creating the necessary HTML files, start the Nginx server and ensure it is configured to serve the correct root directory .
  - Use the command `nginx -s reload` to apply configuration changes .

- **Content Types**: Nginx automatically determines the content type based on the file extension. For example, HTML files are served with the content type `text/html` .

- **Handling CSS Files**: 
  - When serving CSS files, ensure they are linked correctly in the HTML file. The content type for CSS files should be `text/css` .
  - If Nginx does not recognize the CSS file type, you may need to manually configure it in the Nginx settings .

- **Configuration for Different File Types**: 
  - To serve different file types correctly, you can specify MIME types in the configuration file. This ensures that files like CSS and images are served with the appropriate content type .

- **Using Include Statements**: Instead of manually specifying types for each file, you can include a predefined MIME types file in your Nginx configuration. This simplifies the process of serving various file types .

- **Testing Configuration**: Always test your Nginx configuration after making changes using the command `nginx -t`. This checks for syntax errors and ensures the configuration is valid .

- **Final Checks**: After reloading Nginx, verify that all static files are being served correctly by accessing them through a web browser or using tools like Postman to check the response headers .

This summary captures the essential steps and concepts for serving static content using Nginx, providing a clear guide for setting up and configuring a web server for static files.


**Full Node.js Deployment: NGINX, SSL with Let's Encrypt**

This video details deploying a full Node.js application using AWS and NGINX, including SSL setup with Let's Encrypt.  Here's a breakdown of the steps:

**1. AWS Account Setup:**

*   Create a free AWS account.  You'll need to provide credit card information, but AWS won't charge you unless you exceed free tier limits.  

**2. Launching an EC2 Instance:**

*   Launch an EC2 instance (Elastic Compute Cloud - a virtual server). Select a region closest to your location (e.g., Mumbai) for lower latency.  
*   Choose an operating system (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04).  
*   Select an instance type (e.g., t2.medium - 2 CPUs, 4GB RAM).  Larger instances are more expensive but offer better performance. 
*   Create a key pair for secure access to your instance.  Keep this key pair safe; losing it means losing access to your instance.   
*   Configure security groups to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic.  
*   Launch the instance.  It takes some time to become fully operational. 
*   Associate a static Elastic IP address to your instance to maintain a consistent public IP address.   

**3. Accessing and Setting up the Instance:**

*   Connect to your instance using SSH (Secure Shell) via your key pair.  The method varies slightly depending on your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).    

**4. Node.js and Application Deployment:**

*   Update the system packages.    
*   Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).  
*   Clone your Node.js project. 
*   Install project dependencies using `npm install`. 
*   Use `pm2` (process manager) to run your application in the background.       

**5. NGINX Setup:**

*   Install NGINX.  
*   Configure NGINX to proxy requests to your Node.js application (port 8000).         

**6. SSL Certificate with Let's Encrypt:**

*   Obtain and install an SSL certificate using Certbot (Let's Encrypt client).       <chunk>483016d0-9db4-4c
