**Introduction to Nginx**

Nginx () is a powerful web server that uses a non-threaded, event-driven architecture ().  It's primarily known for its role as a reverse proxy (), load balancer (), and HTTP caching () server.

**How Nginx Works as a Reverse Proxy**

In a typical HTTP connection, a client directly connects to a server ().  With Nginx acting as a reverse proxy, the client communicates with Nginx, which then forwards the request to the appropriate backend server ().  The response is then sent back to the client through Nginx (). This differs from a forward proxy (, , ) where multiple clients use the proxy to access a single server.  The key difference is that in a reverse proxy, the client is unaware of the backend server (), while in a forward proxy, the server is unaware of the client's true location.  Google Maps (, ) is an example of a website likely using a reverse proxy setup.

**Nginx Features and Advantages**

*   **Load Balancing:** Nginx distributes requests across multiple servers to prevent overload (, ).  Algorithms like round-robin can be used ().
*   **HTTP Caching:** Nginx caches frequently accessed content (like images) to speed up response times (, ).
*   **Handles High Concurrency:** Nginx can handle a large number of concurrent requests (10,000+) ().
*   **API Gateway:**  Nginx can act as an API gateway ().
*   **SSL Certificate Handling:** Nginx can manage SSL certificates ().
*   **Serving Static Files:** Efficiently serves static files like images and videos ().


**Configuration and Prerequisites**

To work effectively with Nginx, familiarity with Docker (, , , ) and basic Linux commands () is recommended.  A free Vultr account (, ) might also be helpful for deployment.  The instructor assumes basic Node.js knowledge ().  Nginx configuration involves defining rules for routing requests to different servers based on various parameters ().


**Study Guide for Installing and Setting Up Nginx**

**Introduction to Docker**
- Docker is a form of virtualization that allows you to run applications in containers, which are lightweight virtual machines .

**Setting Up the Environment**
- Before installing Nginx, ensure your Docker environment is ready. You can connect to the terminal of your Docker container .

**Updating Packages**
- Update local packages in the container to ensure you have the latest versions before installation .

**Installing Nginx**
- Install Nginx using the command:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install nginx
  ```
  This command will initiate the installation process .

**Verifying Installation**
- After installation, verify that Nginx is running by checking the version:
  ```
  nginx -v
  ```
  If successful, you should see the version number displayed .

**Accessing Nginx**
- Nginx typically runs on port 80. If you're using Docker, you may need to map this port to a different one (e.g., 8080) for access . Access it via your browser at `localhost:8080`.

**Default Page Check**
- If you see the default Nginx welcome page, it confirms that Nginx is running correctly .

**Configuration Files**
- Nginx configuration files are located in the `/etc/nginx` directory. The main configuration file is `nginx.conf` .

**Editing Configuration**
- Use a text editor (like nano) to edit the configuration file. Before making changes, create a backup of the original configuration .

**Basic Configuration Example**
- A simple server block in the configuration file might look like this:
  ```
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name localhost;

      location / {
          root /usr/share/nginx/html;
          index index.html index.htm;
      }
  }
  ```
  This block listens on port 80 and serves files from the specified root directory .

**Testing Configuration**
- After editing, test the configuration syntax using:
  ```
  nginx -t
  ```
  This command checks for syntax errors .

**Reloading Nginx**
- If there are no errors, reload Nginx to apply the changes:
  ```
  sudo systemctl reload nginx
  ```
  This command ensures your new configuration is active .

**Conclusion**
- You can run multiple server blocks and customize configurations as needed. Experiment with different settings to understand how Nginx operates .
